# Asthma Prediction

This project aims to predict the presence of asthma based on various symptoms and demographic information using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and prediction of asthma can help in better management and treatment of the condition. This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict asthma presence based on symptoms such as tiredness, dry cough, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, and demographic factors such as age and gender.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepayanthakur/asthma-disease-prediction). It contains information about individuals' symptoms, demographic characteristics, and asthma presence (target variable).
